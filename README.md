###Project Pitch

Ever wanted to keep track of your favourite TMZ celebrities, but you were too embarassed to add them on Instagram? Now you can, and even if your friends nick your phone: they'll be none the wiser.

###Concept

We are designing a proof of concept page to demonstrate the capability to use the Instagram API to keep track of a list of usernames in real time, alongside the ability to track hashtags.

###Workflow

Managed using pivotal tracker. The front end designer (Jack Rans) is designing the pages with testing, translated and optimised by devops (Jack M) using jade/harp to compile. Lukas (Architect) and Abdi (API) are working together to design the requirements for the API and test its functionality.
